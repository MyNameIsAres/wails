# 文档

该网站也是该项目的主要文件网站。 有时候这会使 过时，需要一些小的调整。 有些文档也没有按照最佳标准写入 。 开发文档是很困难的，因此我们非常感谢 的任何贡献。 This website is also the main documentation site for the project. Sometimes this gets out of date and needs some slight adjustments. Some of the documentation isn't written to the best standards either. Developing documentation is hard and so any contribution to this is greatly appreciated. Features without documentation are unfinished so to the project, it's *as important* as the code.

We generally do not create tickets for updating documentation so if there is text you think should be updated or rephrased then feel free to submit a PR for that. This site is in the main repository under the `website` directory. We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to create the site so there is plenty of existing documentation and tutorials around to get started. 此网站 位于主仓库的 `网站` 目录下。 我们使用 [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) 来创建 站点，所以有大量的现有文档和教程可以开始。

To set up a local documentation development environment, do the following:

- [Install npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/install)
- `cd website`
- `npm install`
- `npm run start`

After it has all installed and is running, you should see the site at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). Any changes made to the site text will be immediately reflected in the browser. 对站点文本的任何更改将立即反映在浏览器中。

## Versioning

We employ a versioning system where we have the "latest" documentation AKA "Next Version" which has all the changes that have occurred since the last release. We also keep the last release documentation as well as the version before that. 我们还保留上次发布的 文档以及之前的版本。

There isn't usually a reason to update released documentation so we don't generally update the documents in the `versioned_docs` or `versioned_sidebars` directories.

The "next version" docs are mainly in `website/docs` with some "version independent" documents in `src/pages`. Any updates should be made in the `website/docs` directory. 任何更新都应该在 `网站/文档` 目录中进行。
